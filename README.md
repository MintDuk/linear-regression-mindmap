## 🚀 About this project

This work is part of **Project Falcon** – my 5-year roadmap to become an AI engineer in aerospace and robotics.

🛠 Tools: Pen & Paper  
🎓 Skills: Mathematical thinking, loss analysis, scientific visualization  
🛰️ Future goal: Build ML-powered robotic systems for Mars exploration and autonomous rockets.

## 📌 Next steps

- Implement Linear Regression from scratch (NumPy)
- Apply the model to a real-world dataset (e.g. satellite cost estimation)
- Extend this project with TinyML experiments (coming soon!)
